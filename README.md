# <Random-Password-Generator>

## Description

This project was intended to make a random password generator that produces a password that meets set parameters. As well as this the application need to adapt to the screen it's being viewed on via media queries in css. This project was intended to help me practice the creation of functions, methods and working between html, css and javascript, - as none of my projects until now have combined all three to such an extent. This password generator tries to produce a password that is secure as possible by making sure the password is made at a random length between 10 and 64 characters, as well as including a random number of upper case, lower case, numeric and special characters. If the generated password does not match the required length and complexity, the browser returns an alert and prompts the user to hit generate button again.

I enjoyed learning how to hide and show a block using javascript functions and found learning how the .addEventListener method works - which is all new to me.
